* **Appointment Scheduling:** Successful scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellation of appointments.
* **Medical Records Access:**  Secure access to patient records with appropriate authorization.
* **Prescription Management:** Successful refill requests and medication reminders.
* **Success Metrics:**  User registration rate, active user count, appointment scheduling rate, message volume, user satisfaction scores (CSAT).
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  Testing with a representative group of patients to ensure usability and functionality.


**7. Release Criteria:**

* **MVP:** Patient registration, secure messaging, appointment scheduling, and basic medical record access.
* **Launch Readiness Checklist:**  Completion of all functional and non-functional testing, security audits, and user acceptance testing.  Deployment plan and rollback strategy in place.
* **Post-Launch Monitoring:**  Monitoring application performance, user engagement, and security logs.  Continuous feedback collection and iterative improvements.


**8. Assumptions and Dependencies:**
