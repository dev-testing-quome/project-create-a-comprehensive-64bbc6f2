## Product Requirements Document: project-create-a-comprehensive - Healthcare Patient Portal

**1. Title:**  Secure Patient Portal: A Comprehensive Healthcare Management System

**2. Overview:**

This document outlines the requirements for "Secure Patient Portal," a HIPAA-compliant web application built using FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend) to provide patients with secure access to their healthcare information and facilitate communication with their providers.  The application aims to improve patient engagement, streamline healthcare processes, and enhance the overall patient experience.  Its value proposition lies in consolidating various healthcare functions into a single, user-friendly, and secure platform.

**3. Functional Requirements:**

* **Patient Registration & Authentication:**  Secure user registration, login, and password management with multi-factor authentication options.  HIPAA-compliant data encryption and storage.
* **Secure Messaging:**  Encrypted messaging system between patients and providers, with message history tracking and notification features.
* **Appointment Scheduling:**  Online appointment scheduling with calendar integration (Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar), provider availability visualization, and appointment reminders.
* **Medical Records Access:**  Secure access to medical records, including lab results, imaging reports, and uploaded documents.  Ability to download documents.
* **Prescription Management:**  View current prescriptions, refill requests (with provider approval workflow), and medication history.  Integration with pharmacy systems (potential future enhancement).
* **Telemedicine Integration:**  Integration with a telemedicine platform for virtual consultations (e.g., Zoom, specialized HIPAA-compliant video conferencing).
* **Billing & Insurance Claims Tracking:**  View billing statements, submit insurance claims, and track claim status.  Integration with billing and claims processing systems (potential future enhancement).
* **Automated Appointment Reminders:**  Automated SMS and email reminders for upcoming appointments.
* **Patient Profile Management:**  Ability to update personal information, contact details, and emergency contacts.


**User Workflows (Example: Appointment Scheduling):**

1. Patient logs in.
2. Patient navigates to the "Appointments" section.

* Potential future integration with pharmacy and billing/claims processing systems.


**4. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **Performance:**  Page load times under 2 seconds.  API response times under 500ms.
* **Security:**  HIPAA compliance, including data encryption, access controls, audit trails, and regular security audits.  Penetration testing required before launch.
* **Scalability:**  Ability to handle a large number of concurrent users and data volume.  Horizontal scaling architecture.
* **Usability:**  Intuitive and user-friendly interface.  Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA).


**5. Technical Requirements:**

* **Technology Stack:**  FastAPI (backend), React (frontend), PostgreSQL (database), Redis (caching).
* **API Specifications:**  RESTful API using OpenAPI specification (Swagger).  Detailed API documentation.
* **Database Schema Considerations:**  Relational database design adhering to data normalization principles.  Strict data validation to ensure data integrity.  HIPAA-compliant data storage and encryption.
* **Third-Party Integrations:**  Clearly defined APIs and integration protocols for all third-party services.


**6. Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Patient Registration:**  Successful registration with valid data validation and account activation.
* **Secure Messaging:**  End-to-end encryption verified.  Message delivery and receipt confirmed.
* **Appointment Scheduling:**  Successful scheduling, calendar integration, and reminder delivery.
* **Medical Records Access:**  Secure access with appropriate authorization and data integrity.
* **All other features:**  Similar detailed acceptance criteria will be defined for each feature.

**Success Metrics & KPIs:**

* Number of registered users.
* Number of appointments scheduled.
* Average session duration.
* User satisfaction scores (surveys).
* Number of messages sent.
* System uptime.

**User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  A minimum of 20 users representing diverse demographics and technical proficiency will participate in UAT.


**7. Release Criteria:**

* **MVP Definition:**  Patient registration, secure messaging, and appointment scheduling.
* **Launch Readiness Checklist:**  All functional and non-functional requirements met.  Security audit completed.  UAT successfully completed.  Deployment plan finalized.
* **Post-Launch Monitoring:**  Regular monitoring of system performance, security, and user feedback.  Bug tracking and resolution.
