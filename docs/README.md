## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Backend setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the application:**  (Run these commands in separate terminal windows)
   * **Backend (from `backend` directory):**
     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```
   * **Frontend (from `frontend` directory):**
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```


### Docker Setup

1.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2.  Ensure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.
3.  Run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.
