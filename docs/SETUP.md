# Developer Setup Guide - project-create-a-comprehensive

This guide outlines the setup process for developers working on `project-create-a-comprehensive`, a HIPAA-compliant healthcare patient portal.  We'll use a combination of Python (backend), React (frontend), and PostgreSQL (database).  Docker is the recommended setup method for ease of use and consistency.

## Prerequisites

* **Required Software Versions:**
    * Python 3.9+
    * Node.js 16+
    * npm 8+
    * PostgreSQL 14+
    * Docker Desktop (for Docker option)
    * Docker Compose (for Docker option)

* **Development Tools:**
    * Git
    * Text editor/IDE (VS Code recommended)

* **IDE Recommendations and Configurations:**
    * **VS Code:** Install the following extensions:
        * Python
        * ESLint
        * Prettier
        * Docker


## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

1. **Clone repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Docker Setup Commands:** Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.

3. **Development `docker-compose.yml` Configuration:**  (Example - adapt to your project structure)

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     backend:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db:5432/database_name
         - SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key  # Replace with a strong secret key
         # ... other environment variables
       depends_on:
         - db
     frontend:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       depends_on:
         - backend
     db:
       image: postgres:14
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=user
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
         - POSTGRES_DB=database_name
   ```

4. **Hot Reload Setup:**  The specific hot reload mechanism will depend on your frontend framework (React in this example). You might use tools like `nodemon` for the backend and `react-hot-loader` or similar for the frontend.  Configure these within the respective `Dockerfile`s.


### Option 2: Native Development

1. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Setup:** Install PostgreSQL and create a database.  Configure the database connection details in your application's configuration files.


## Environment Configuration

* **Required Environment Variables:**  (Example)
    * `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string.
    * `SECRET_KEY`:  Secret key for session management.
    * `EMAIL_HOST`: Email server configuration.
    * `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Twilio account SID for SMS.
    * `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Twilio auth token.
    * `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Stripe secret key for billing.
    * `HIPAA_COMPLIANCE_SETTINGS`:  Configuration for HIPAA compliance features.


* **Local Development `.env` File Setup:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or appropriate location) and populate it with your local development environment variables.  **Do not commit this file to version control.**

* **Configuration for Different Environments:** Use environment variables or configuration files to manage settings for different environments (development, staging, production).


## Running the Application

* **Start Commands for Development:** (Docker)
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```
   (Native)
   ```bash
   # Run backend and frontend servers separately.
   ```

* **How to access frontend and backend:** Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in `docker-compose.yml` or your configuration) and the backend API at `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate port).

* **API Documentation Access:** Use a tool like Swagger or generate documentation from your API code.


## Development Workflow

* **Git Workflow and Branching Strategy:** Use Gitflow or a similar branching strategy (e.g., `main`, feature branches).

* **Code Formatting and Linting Setup:** Use tools like `black` (Python) and `eslint` (JavaScript) with Prettier for consistent code formatting.  Configure these in your IDE and potentially in CI/CD.

* **Testing Procedures:** Implement unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests.

* **Debugging Setup:** Use your IDE's debugger and logging tools.


## Database Management

* **Running Migrations:** Use a migration tool (e.g., Alembic for SQLAlchemy) to manage database schema changes.

* **Seeding Development Data:** Create scripts to populate your database with sample data for development.

* **Database Reset Procedures:**  Implement scripts to easily reset your database to a clean state.


## Testing

* **Running Unit Tests:**  Use a testing framework (e.g., `pytest` for Python, `Jest` for JavaScript) to run unit tests.

* **Running Integration Tests:** Test interactions between different components of your application.

* **Test Coverage Reports:** Generate reports to track your test coverage.


## Common Development Tasks

* **Adding new API endpoints:**  Follow your project's API design guidelines and write tests.

* **Adding new frontend components:**  Use your frontend framework's component model and ensure proper styling and functionality.

* **Database schema changes:**  Use migrations to manage schema changes and update your models accordingly.

* **Adding dependencies:** Use `pip` (Python) and `npm` (JavaScript) to add new dependencies. Remember to update your `requirements.txt` and `package.json` files.


## Troubleshooting

* **Common Setup Issues:** Check Docker logs, database connection details, and environment variables.

* **Port Conflicts Resolution:** Change the ports defined in your `docker-compose.yml` or configuration files.

* **Dependency Issues:** Check your `requirements.txt` and `package.json` for conflicting dependencies. Use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

* **Environment Variable Problems:** Verify that your environment variables are correctly set and accessible to your application.


## Contributing

* **Code Style Guidelines:** Follow PEP 8 (Python) and your chosen JavaScript style guide (e.g., Airbnb).

* **Pull Request Process:** Create feature branches, write clear commit messages, and submit pull requests for review.

* **Issue Reporting:** Use the project's issue tracker to report bugs and suggest features.  Provide clear and concise descriptions with reproduction steps.


This guide provides a foundation for setting up and working on `project-create-a-comprehensive`. Remember to adapt it to your specific project structure and technologies.  Always prioritize HIPAA compliance throughout the development process.  Consult with legal and security experts to ensure your application meets all relevant regulations.
